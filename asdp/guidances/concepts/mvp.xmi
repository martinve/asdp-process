    A Minimum Viable Product has just those features that allow the product to be deployed, and no more. The product is&#xD;
    typically deployed to a subset of possible customers, such as early adopters that are thought to be more forgiving,&#xD;
    more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. It&#xD;
    is a strategy targeted at avoiding building products that customers do not want, that seeks to maximize the information&#xD;
    learned about the customer per dollar spent. &quot;The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows&#xD;
    a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.&quot; The definition's use&#xD;
    of the words maximum and minimum means it is decidedly not formulaic. It requires judgment to figure out, for any given&#xD;
    context, what MVP makes sense.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An MVP is not a minimal product, it is a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to&#xD;
    customers. It is an iterative process of idea generation, prototyping, presentation, data collection, analysis and&#xD;
    learning. One seeks to minimize the total time spent on an iteration. The process is iterated until a desirable&#xD;
    product-market fit is obtained, or until the product is deemed to be non-viable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
